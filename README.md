# AI-Driven Real-Time Transaction Anomaly Detection  
### Powered by Apache Kafka, Pathway, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

---

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-time AI streaming pipeline** where:
- üßæ A **Python producer** streams synthetic transactions into **Kafka**
- ‚ö° **Pathway** consumes and filters suspicious transactions live
- üß† **LangChain + GPT-4o-mini** analyze each suspicious case to generate AI explanations
- üì° Results are sent back to Kafka for further visualization or action

Designed to run seamlessly across:
- **Windows Docker (Kafka)**
- **Ubuntu 24.04 via WSL2 (Pathway + LangChain)**

## Setup Instructions

1Ô∏è‚É£ Kafka on Windows (Docker)
Created a file named **docker-compose.yml** to start apache/kafka on docker:

Run: 
  ```bash docker compose up -d```

Check: 
  ```docker ps```

Create topics:

  ```docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics --create --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092```
  
  ```docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics --create --topic alerts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092```
  
  ```docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics --create --topic ai_alerts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092```



2Ô∏è‚É£ WSL2 (Ubuntu) ‚Äî Python Environment

Create a virtual environment:

  ```python3 -m venv pathway-env```
  ```source pathway-env/bin/activate```

Install dependencies:

  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Set your OpenAI key:

  export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxx"

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Components

üßæ Producer(in Windows)

  ```python producer.py```

‚ö° Pathway Consumer(in WSL2)

  ```python3 pathway_consumer1.py```

 ‚ö† Alerts(in Windows)
 
  ```docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer --topic alerts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning```

üß† LangChain AI Service(in WSL2)

  ```python3 langchain_service.py```


4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify in Kafka

Check topics:

  ```docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092```

  Three topics: transactions , alerts and ai_alerts

Consume messages:

  ```docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer --topic ai_alerts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning```


The anonymous transcations are outputted like this with explaination: 

AI explanation: This transaction might be considered suspicious for several reasons:
1. **Unusual Amount**: The amount of 819.06 could be significantly higher than typical transaction amounts for the user or within the region, raising flags.
2. **Timestamp and Transaction Diff**: The proximity of the timestamp and time suggests that this transaction occurred very rapidly, which could indicate automated or fraudulent behavior.
3. **Country**: Depending on the user's usual transaction behavior, a transaction from or to a certain country may be flagged as suspicious. If this user typically makes transactions in a different country, it could raise concerns about identity theft or unauthorized transactions.
4. **User Profile**: If user_id 46 is a new or relatively inactive account that suddenly engages in high-value transactions, this might also indicate suspicious activity.

Considering these factors, the transaction could warrant further investigation to determine its legitimacy.
